# ♟️NumChess - Yet another chess website!



The project is hosted on Heroku and can be viewed [here](https://num-chess.herokuapp.com).

## Features

- **Matchmaking!** Click on 'Find game' and get matched up against a random opponent.
- **Rooms!** If you want to play a friend, get a room!
- **Dark mode!** A chess website that has dark mode enabled by default? Unheard of!
- **Local multiplayer!** Pretty self explanatory; play with someone physically near you.
- **Move validation!** All moves are validated by the chess engine. Valid moves are displayed on clicking a piece. All forms of draws - stalemate, mutual agreement, threefold repetition, and insufficient material - are detected and handled.
- **Timer!** In online games, you and your opponent each get 10 minutes, exceeding which will result in a loss.
- **Robust!** As robust as I could make it, anyway. Should withstand temporary disconnection and browser reloads just fine.

> NumChess? I'm sorry, haven't heard of it before. That's a weird name if I'm being honest. Does it have something to do with numbers?

> You should monetize this.

> _- My brother, when I averaged 10 website visits a month_
